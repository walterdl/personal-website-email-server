**[Take a look at the front-end](https://walterdevia.com)**

The email server repository of my personal website project. It was developed as a [Zeit Now lambda function](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction/) with:

- TypeScript.
- [mailgun.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mailgun-js)


The code can be found in the original GitLab repository in [this link](https://gitlab.com/walterdevia-personal-website/email-server).
